In this project, we build on top of the idea of using logs to examine the behaviour of a software system by applying it to multi-agent systems with a novel angle which is to include multiple levels of explanation generated from the same set of logs. Commonly, explainability in agent systems is achieved by focusing on a single agent that produces a single explanation for a single purpose. Our research introduces a different approach by presenting an explainability framework for agents and multi-agent systems that deals with multiple levels of abstraction that can be used for different purposes by different classes of users.
