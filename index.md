ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I am **Elena Yan**, currently a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the [Department of Computer Science and Intelligent Systems](https://www.mines-stetienne.fr/recherche/centres-et-departements/departement-informatique-et-systemes-intelligents/) of the Institut Henri FAYOL at [Ã‰cole des Mines de Saint-Ã‰tienne](https://www.mines-stetienne.fr/en/) in France. 
My [thesis](https://theses.fr/s394631) focuses on developing self-adaptive regulation mechanisms in multi-agent systems, supervised by [Olivier Boissier](https://www.emse.fr/~boissier/), [Jaime S. Sichman](https://www2.pcs.usp.br/~jaime/index_engl.html), and [Luis G. Nardin](https://gustavo.nardin.info).

I obtained my master and bachelor degrees in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://corsi.unibo.it/2cycle/ComputerScienceEngineering) at the [University of Bologna](https://www.unibo.it/en/homepage) in Italy, supervised by [Alessandro Ricci](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/a.ricci/en).


My research interests center around multi-agent systems and engineering methodologies, with the aim of deploying regulated, adaptive and trustworthy systems. My current research focuses on the development of a model and mechanisms for multi-agent systems able to self-regulate and adapt regulations for a trustworthy and sustainable industry of future. Some keywords are:

- Normative Multi-Agent Systems
- Self-Adaptation
- Software Engineering
- BDI Agents
- Industry of the Future
