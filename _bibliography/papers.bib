  abstract     = {Explainability is more and more considered a crucial property to be featured by AI-based systems, including those engineered in terms of agents and multi-agent systems. This property is primarily important at the user level, to increase e.g. system trustworthiness, but can play an important role also at the engineering level, to support activities such as debugging and validation. In this paper, we focus on BDI agent systems and introduce a multi-level explainability framework to understand the system's behaviour that targets different classes of users: developers who implement the system, software designers who verify the soundness and final users. A prototype implementation of a tool based on the JaCaMo platform for multi-agent systems is adopted to explore the idea in practice.},
